## Project Name 
Impact of various factors on car manufacturers stock prices & car sales

## Project description 
This project is about statistically analyzing various car stocks  and see how inflation, unemployment, commodities like oil, metals like silver, gold, silicon affected the car stock prices between 2014 and 2021. This is an important step in our full-stack journey as we will now use our newly acquired skills and knowledge in this project.

     * Creating a dataframe with the acquired monthly data of stock prices from Api calls to yahoo finance of 10 car manufacturers
     * Analysing the data 
     * Doing calculations to get the monthly returns and cumulative returns
     * Creating plots with the analyzed data to visualize how unemployment affected car stocks monthly and cumulative returns of stocks 
     * Also how unemployment affected car sales across the country
     * Finally analyzing how car stocks, car sales, are correlated with unemployment.
